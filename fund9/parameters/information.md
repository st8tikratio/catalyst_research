| Mechanism to prevent price fluctuation | Proposals will be paid the $ value they requested in ada, according to ada valuation at reward distribution date. 3,200,000ada total rewards for Voters + advisors + referrers + challenge teams will be provided according to ada valuation on reward distribution date. | |
| Fund goals | Attract more developers <p></p> Build real live solutions based on the Cardano blockchain. <p></p> Improve tooling to support human processes in Catalyst | Fund goals to be presented in the Voting App. <p></p> Survey results collected between 4/20 - 5/19. 1045 votes cast, on 31 statements, by 47 unique participants. [Results](https://pol.is/report/r4dafyewbkcrkm8c7exjb). Took top 3 by (yes minus no). Combined 2 / 26 due to similarity, taking the more general “solutions” over “applications”. Broke tie on 10 / 19 based on number of participants + disagreement.|
| Maximum proposals that can be put on the ballot | No limit | |
| Community advisor registration | Through Ideascale | Everyone can register as a Community Advisor. They can’t do CA work in the challenge they are proposing to or are involved with a proposal team.|
| Proposals registration on the blockchain | Rust/Devops dev | The registration of proposals on the blockchain will be done in the future by an elected committee. |
| Voting power threshold | 450,000,000 lovelace. (450 ada) <p></p> Communicate threshold as 500 to account for tx fees | Minimal stake threshold to become a voter, based on the efficiency benchmarks of the voting protocol. <p></p> Specific value of the voting stake threshold will be defined by the protocol benchmarks. <p></p> Note that threshold must be lowered by 50 ada from the amount stated to the community to address registration fees.|
| Registration start time | 07/Apr/2022, 12:00 UTC | Registrations made after 03/06/2021 16:00 UTC are valid. Official registration start time starts an hour after the previous Fund snapshot. | 
| Registration snapshot date | 04/Aug/2022, 11:00 UTC | | 
| Voting period start time| 11/Aug/2022, 07:00 UTC <p></p> Communicate: 11/Aug/2022, 11:00 UTC | (A block height bound to) UTC date and time when voters can start voting on proposals |
| Voting period end time | 25/Aug/2022, 11:00 UTC | |
| Start of tallying | 25/Aug/2022, 11:00 UTC | | 
| End of tallying | 02/Sep/2022, 11:00 UTC | UTC date and time by which the committee shall post the decrypted tally. |
| next_fund_start_time | 04/Aug/2022, 12:00 UTC | When registration phase for the next Fund starts | 
| fund_id | 9 | Fund_id as described in vote plan |
| Jormungandr Tallying optimization | 1 ADA = 1 voting token (i.e. the stake amount in lovelace is divided by 1000000) | How voting power is being proportionally reduced in order to optimize tallying performance |
| Proposal Funding logic (winner selection rule) | Proposals are ranked by the difference of Yes and No votes and funded one by one until challenge budget is exhausted | Proposals are ranked by sum of votes and funded in order. If the amount requested by a proposal is larger than the remaining challenge amount, it is skipped. | 
| Proposal acceptance threshold | 1% of total voting power <p></p> 15% more ‘Yes’ than ‘No’ | At least 1% of the total registered stake must vote on a proposal. <p></p> E.g., there is 1 billion ADA as a total registered stake. Then to be accepted (become an ‘approved proposal’ as well as be eligible for funding), a proposal must be voted by at least 0.01 * (1 * 10^9) = 10 millions of ADA. <p></p> 'Yes'-'No' difference of the stake voted on proposal must be at least 15% <p></p> (e.g., 90% 'Yes' and 10% 'No', or 57.5% 'Yes' and 42.5% 'No', or 100% 'Yes' and 0% 'No', etc.; it is assumed that abstained stake does not vote on the proposal in the current architecture).|
| $Vr_{total}$ | 13% <br> 2,080,000ada | Total amount of rewards for voters out of total funds in treasury |
| $Rr_{total}$ | 1% <br> 160,000ada | Referral rewards |
| $Ar_{total}$ | 4% <br> 640,000ada | Community advisor reward | 
| $AAr_{total}$ | 1% <br> 160,000ada | Reviewing reviewers reward |
|               | 1% <br> 5,000ada per team <br> Up to 160,000ada | Challenge team reward <p></p> Base reward of 5k per team Remaining funds after base rewards will be split proportionally among challenge teams according to number of funded proposals relative to total <p></p> “CT rewards total: 160,000ada CT base rewards: 5,000ada Leftovers: 45,000ada (23 teams x 5,000ada = 115,000ada; 160,000ada - 115,000ada = 45,000ada) after voting we can define bonus incentive per proposal, let's assume 500 proposals will get funded <br> Bonus per proposal: 90ada (45,000ada / 500 proposals = 90ada) <br> So for example, assuming that in Gamers On-Chained proposal 15 proposals get funds then its Challenge Team reward will be: 6,350ada (5,000ada base + 1,350ada bonus)” |
| Voter reward formula | $Vr_j = (stake_j/stake_{total})Vr_{total}$ | Voter rewards will be given for active participants only in proportion to the voting power votes have. <p></p> $stake_j$ - voter’s stake; $stake_{total}$ - total amount of ‘active’ stake.|
| Advisor reward formula | Each proposal rewards budget fits 2 Excellent and 3 Good assessments. If there are more than 2 Excellent or 3 Good assessments, a lottery system is used. Bonus rewards are available (20% of total CA rewards budget) for assessments ‘Approved’ by the community, proportional to the proposal budget | If there are more assessments than what the budget can pay for, a [double lottery system](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wYMgoNJ8Pf2pGVKCiblniEbMERjtrLrAHC6Zs2JbfyU/edit#slide=id.gb84ae6e7f7_0_10) is used. The total CAs assessments budget for that proposal is divided in 36 parts. Each ‘Excellent’ assessment receives 12 lottery tickets, and each ‘Good’ assessment, 4 tickets. |
