# Catalyst Research

This is a newly created repo (07 Oct 2022) and is the beginning of a personal journey to track, compile, 
formulate and derive informative data from the various activities conducted in Cardano Project Catalyst. Having come this far, might as well continue on
with additional research.

Do not expect there to be newly derived data on a weekly or even monthly basis. However, over time I will post improvement suggestions and relevant data with the hopes of creating a more informed community and a more transparent blockchain.

There are numerous issues with Project Catalyst and I hope to identify these withing this repo.
