| Fund goals | Attract more developers <p></p> Build real live solutions based on the Cardano blockchain. <p></p> Improve tooling to support human processes in Catalyst | Fund goals to be presented in the Voting App. <p></p> Survey results collected between 4/20 - 5/19. 1045 votes cast, on 31 statements, by 47 unique participants. [Results](https://pol.is/report/r4dafyewbkcrkm8c7exjb). Took top 3 by (yes minus no). Combined 2 / 26 due to similarity, taking the more general “solutions” over “applications”. Broke tie on 10 / 19 based on number of participants + disagreement.| - |
| Maximum proposals that can be put on the ballot | No limit | **A maximum of two proposals per funding round. This includes being listed on non-authored proposals or mentoring. <p></p> If a team has one open and funded proposal in $Fund_n$ they may submit one proposal** | **Reduced the unnecessary overhead of extraneous auditing processes due to completion date pushback from funded proposers. <p></p> Reduces the opportunity of overextension, continual funding exercises, increases fairness of fund distribution and promotes sustainability** |
| Community advisor registration | Through Ideascale | **Change CA and Community Advisor to match current naming conventions**| **Everyone can register as a Proposal Assessor. They can’t do PA work in the challenge they are proposing to or are involved with a proposal team.** |
| Proposals registration on the blockchain | Rust/Devops dev | **What is this committee's title and who determines the committee makeup?** | The registration of proposals on the blockchain will be done in the future by an elected committee. |

The change promotes equality and moves us closer to one wallet / one vote.** |

|  **Rewards Parameters** | **===================** | **===================** | 
| Proposal Funding logic (winner selection rule) | Proposals are ranked by the difference of Yes and No votes and funded one by one until challenge budget is exhausted | Proposals are ranked by sum of votes and funded in order. If the amount requested by a proposal is larger than the remaining challenge amount, it is skipped. | 
| Proposal acceptance threshold | 1% of total voting power <p></p> 15% more ‘Yes’ than ‘No’ | At least 1% of the total registered stake must vote on a proposal. <p></p> E.g., there is 1 billion ADA as a total registered stake. Then to be accepted (become an ‘approved proposal’ as well as be eligible for funding), a proposal must be voted by at least 0.01 * (1 * 10^9) = 10 millions of ADA. <p></p> 'Yes'-'No' difference of the stake voted on proposal must be at least 15% <p></p> (e.g., 90% 'Yes' and 10% 'No', or 57.5% 'Yes' and 42.5% 'No', or 100% 'Yes' and 0% 'No', etc.; it is assumed that abstained stake does not vote on the proposal in the current architecture).|
| $Vr_{total}$ | 13% <br> 2,080,000ada | Total amount of rewards for voters out of total funds in treasury |
| $Rr_{total}$ | 1% <br> 160,000ada | Referral rewards |
| $Ar_{total}$ | 4% <br> 640,000ada | Community advisor reward | 
| $AAr_{total}$ | 1% <br> 160,000ada | Reviewing reviewers reward |
|               | 1% <br> 5,000ada per team <br> Up to 160,000ada | Challenge team reward <p></p> Base reward of 5k per team Remaining funds after base rewards will be split proportionally among challenge teams according to number of funded proposals relative to total <p></p> “CT rewards total: 160,000ada CT base rewards: 5,000ada Leftovers: 45,000ada (23 teams x 5,000ada = 115,000ada; 160,000ada - 115,000ada = 45,000ada) after voting we can define bonus incentive per proposal, let's assume 500 proposals will get funded <br> Bonus per proposal: 90ada (45,000ada / 500 proposals = 90ada) <br> So for example, assuming that in Gamers On-Chained proposal 15 proposals get funds then its Challenge Team reward will be: 6,350ada (5,000ada base + 1,350ada bonus)” |
| Voter reward formula | $Vr_j = (stake_j/stake_{total})Vr_{total}$ | Voter rewards will be given for active participants only in proportion to the voting power votes have. <p></p> $stake_j$ - voter’s stake; <br> $stake_{total}$ - total amount of ‘active’ stake.|
| Advisor reward formula | Each proposal rewards budget fits 2 Excellent and 3 Good assessments. If there are more than 2 Excellent or 3 Good assessments, a lottery system is used. Bonus rewards are available (20% of total CA rewards budget) for assessments ‘Approved’ by the community, proportional to the proposal budget | If there are more assessments than what the budget can pay for, a [double lottery system](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wYMgoNJ8Pf2pGVKCiblniEbMERjtrLrAHC6Zs2JbfyU/edit#slide=id.gb84ae6e7f7_0_10) is used. The total CAs assessments budget for that proposal is divided in 36 parts. Each ‘Excellent’ assessment receives 12 lottery tickets, and each ‘Good’ assessment, 4 tickets. |
| Referral reward calculation | Equal amount distributed between all referrers who referred to a funded proposal per funded proposal | |
| Reviewing the reviews formula | Min threshold = 200 <br> Rewards eligible rank cap = inf <br> Reputation eligible rank cap = inf <p></p> Agreement rate cutoff 1 = .9 <p></p> Cutoff 1 multiplier / discount rate = 1.25 <p></p> Agreement rate cutoff 2 = .8 <p></p> Cutoff 2 multiplier / discount rate = 1 <p></p> Agreement rate cutoff 3 = .7 <p></p> Cutoff 3 multiplier / discount rate = .75 <p></p> Below cutoff discount rate = 0 <p></p> IF agreement >= (.9) THEN final eligible ranking = rewards eligible ranking * BONUS (1.25) <br> IF agreement >= (.8) THEN final eligible ranking = rewards eligible ranking * REGULAR (1) <br> IF agreement >= (.7) THEN final eligible ranking = rewards eligible ranking * SLASH (.75) <br> IF agreement < (.7) THEN final eligible ranking = rewards eligible ranking * FORFEIT (0) and these reviews/rankings will be excluded before voting | Veteran community advisors should receive rewards proportional to the number of eligible rankings, to avoid incentivizing bad faith or negligent participation <p></p> Veteran community advisors rankings should be eligible for rewards only when they agree with the majority, in order to incentivize rational and honest participation. For simplicity, only consider filtered out vs good / excellent <p></p> Formulas and references can be found in the [Fund8 - vCA Eligibility & Incentives Requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14qHSZ2uSHq2CZyeqju6KLBcGVfagesCLvavZMAgcbWo/edit) |
| Contingency for vCA rewards | 5% of $AAr_{total}$ <br> 8,000ada | Funds allocated to pay vCAs after petition outcome

(450 ada) <p></p> Communicate threshold as 500 to account for tx fees | Minimal stake threshold to become a voter, based on the efficiency benchmarks of the voting protocol. <p></p> Specific value of the voting stake threshold will be defined by the protocol benchmarks. <p></p> Note that threshold must be lowered by 50 ada from the amount stated to the community to address registration fees. |
