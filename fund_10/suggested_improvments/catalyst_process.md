If we require every proposer to acknowledge each assessment either by comment or check-box this will help immensely. If proposers fail to do this then the proposal is filtered out but assessments are still reviewed (it is not the PA at fault) so PAs may still be rewarded for work. This is post-PA and pre-vPA stage, the flagging stage (as it is now). This should be changed to Proposer Review stage. At the end of this stage a screen is ran to determine if proposers fulfilled their responsibility. The resulting spreadsheet would be inverse where vPAs are encouraged to review assessments where proposers failed to review their respective assessments. Next, the vPA stage would require the review of the proposer feedback, determining any anomalies, true flags, etc. related to the PA work. VPAs are only required to read the entire proposal and determine who is correct when there are opposing opinions. Otherwise vPAs review and “grade” based on the provided assessment contents. 

This should reduce the requirement that vPAs read every proposal associated with each assessment. Overhead minimized, responsibility distributed, proposers do more than just submit they MUST review every assessment.

One further suggestion, though not directly related to the vPA issue, revolves around the PA rewards and nixing the lottery system.

Increase PA rewards to 1.5% of Fund (this would be 240,000 ada).

Excellent assessments receive 0.5% (80,000 ada) of the rewards regardless if there are 2, 10, 50 per proposal. 
- 80,000 divided by [total Excellent assessments]

Good assessments receive 1% (160,000 ada) of the rewards.
- 160,000 divided by [total Good assessments]
