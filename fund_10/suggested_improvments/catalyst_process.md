# Catalyst Process Improvement Suggestions

### _Increase Proposer Responsibility_

#### Reason
- vPA quality is poor
- vPAs fail to read proposals
- vPAs auto-filter proposer flagged assessments
- Proposers only flag assessments that may influence score
  - some Proposers do flag blatant 5-star assessments but this is not the norm
- Proposers should share the burden of the process beyond proposal submission
- Reduces vPA overhead

#### Process Change
1. Every proposer **MUST** acknowledge each assessment either by comment or check-box 
2. Proposers failing to acknowledge assessments will have their proposal filtered out.
3. Assessments are still reviewed (it is not the PA at fault) so PAs may still be rewarded for work
4. This stage is post-PA and pre-vPA stage, the flagging stage (as it is now) and should be changed to Proposer Review stage
5. At stage end a screen is ran to determine if proposers fulfilled their responsibility
6. The resulting **vPA Master File** would be inverse where vPAs are encouraged to review assessments where proposers failed to review their respective assessments.
7. vPA stage will require the review of the proposer feedback, determining any anomalies, true flags, etc. related to the PA work.
8. VPAs are only required to read the entire proposal and determine who is correct when there are opposing opinions.
9. vPAs review and “grade” based on the provided assessment contents. 

#### Benefits
This should reduce the requirement that vPAs read every proposal associated with each assessment under review. Overhead is minimized, responsibility distributed, proposers do more than just submit they **MUST** review every assessment or have their proposal **Filtered Out.**
<p></p>
Options could include a threshold review requirement for proposers such as 85% assessments reviewed to no be filtered out. This would minimize the benefits of such a setup.

### _Remove PA Lottery Rewards_
:memo: _Below are sample figures_. 
> Reward allocation breakout can be whatever is deemed appropriate.

#### Reason
- The current lottery system does not reward all PA work.
- Algorithms make mistakes causing excessive assessments for some proposals at no fault to the PA
- Not rewarding PAs for their work is actually a disincentive and will reduce willing participants

#### Process Change
1. Increase PA Rewards to 1.5% of the Fund pool (240,000 ada)
2. Excellent Assessments - receive 0.5% or 33.33% of the allocated PA Rewards. Total the excellent assessments and divide by excellent reward pool
3. Good Assessments - receive 1% or 66.67% of the allocated PA Rewards. Total the good assessments and divide by good reward pool.

#### Historical Data & Example Figures
- Fund 9 had the assessment counts shown below. Beneath each assessment category is the payout per assessment based on the above percentages (0.5% Excellent, 1.0% Good)
  - Excellent 
    - 473
    - 169.13 ada / assessment
  - Good
    - 9604
    - 16.66 ada / assessment
  - Filter Out (FO)
    - 5321
    - 0 ada

#### Benefits
- Encourages improved assessing and writing skills
